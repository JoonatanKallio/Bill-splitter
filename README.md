Bill splitter
===============
This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor where the point is to create a website using given design images. In this challenge I had to create a bill/tip calculator where the user can change the bill amount, tip % and amount of people who are splitting the bill. The site then provides the correct total amount per person.

# Technologies used
**React** for the UI 

**Sass** for the styling of the application
